Jupyter Notebook is an open-source, web-based interactive computing environment that enables users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Originally developed for Python, it now supports multiple programming languages such as R and Julia through the use of kernels. Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in data science, machine learning, scientific research, and education because they allow users to write and execute code in a cell-based format. This feature helps in breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. The notebook interface includes code cells, markdown cells, and output cells, which together create a highly readable and interactive document. Markdown cells allow users to add formatted text, links, images, and LaTeX-based mathematical expressions, which makes it easier to document the code. The results of each cell, including graphs and tables, appear directly below the code, making it ideal for data analysis and visualization. Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are commonly used within Jupyter for handling data and generating plots. It also supports integration with big data tools and frameworks like TensorFlow and Spark. Notebooks are saved in .ipynb format and can be exported to PDF, HTML, or scripts for sharing. Jupyter can be launched using Anaconda or installed via pip, and runs on a web browser, providing a user-friendly interface. Its flexibility, readability, and ability to combine code with documentation make Jupyter Notebook a powerful tool for both learning and professional development in the programming and data science fields.
